/*A closure may be described as a combination of a function and the lexical environment in which it was declared
The lexical environment consists of any local variables in the functionâ€™s scope when the function is created. 
A closure enables one to refer to all local variables of a function in the state they were found.
This is essentially achieved by defining a function inside another function, 
this function within a function is technically the closure.*/

This is made possible by the fact that Javascript functions are expressions that can return other functions.
Curried functions are constructed by chaining closures by defining and
